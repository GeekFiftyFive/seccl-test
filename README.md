## Task

### Requirements

* We want to create an endpoint that returns an exchange rate pairing.

* User can specify two currencies to return the exchange rate between them.

* Maximum of 3 retries to external API before it fails.

### Notes

Setup correct level of tests that you feel is necessary to cover the requirements, example tests are in the repository.

### Resources
